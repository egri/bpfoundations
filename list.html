<h3>Indistinguishability</h3>
<p> The	concept	of	particle	indistinguishability	thus	construed	faces	some	obvious	challenges.	It	remains	controversial,
now	for	more	than	a	century,	whether	classical	particles	can	be	treated	as	indistinguishable;	or	if	they	can,
whether	the	puzzles	raised	by	Gibbs	are	thereby	solved	or	alleviated;	and	if	so,	how	the	differences	between
quantum	and	classical	statistics	are	to	be	explained.<br>

<h3>Internal Absorption Properties of Accelerating Detectors</h3>
<p> The existence of electromagnetic radiation from a uniformily accelerated
charge has appeared in some recent work to present a problem suggesting the
inadequacy of the equivalence principle. For a proper treatment of the problem,
it is desirable to show how the absorption properties of detectors are
effected by being physically attached to noninertial frames of reference. An
invariant criterion of internal absorption is formulated, and is identified with
the observable behavior of an elementary detector. It is shown that the propertics of a detector fixed in a uniformly accelerated frame are different from the
properties of an inertial detector of similar construction, and that this difference is consistent, with the usual form of the equivalence principle. <br>

<h3>On the Exact Identity Between Thermodynamic and Informatic Entropies in a Unitary Model of Friction (Diósi Lajos?)</h3> 
<p> We consider an elementary collision model of a molecular reservoir upon which an external field is applied and the work is dissipated into heat. To realize macroscopic irreversibility at the microscopic level, we introduce a “graceful” irreversible map which
randomly mixes the identities of the molecules. This map is expected to generate informatic entropy exactly equal to the independently calculable irreversible thermodynamic
entropy. <br>
